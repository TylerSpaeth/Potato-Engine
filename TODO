-Update Javadocs so that code is documented better
-Implement test methods for all of the classes
-Make sure exceptions are thrown when null or inappropriate values are passed to methods
-Make sure that all methods have Constructors for all use cases
-Reorganize all of the classes so that the methods are organized better. Group getters and setters.
